# Exploring Hacker News Posts

#### About The Project  
In this project, we’ll work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as “posts”) receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
#### Aim
The sole aim of this project is to help users identify the kind of stories that would receive more comments and on what exact hour of the day influences more comments when post are created.

#### Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyse the Ask posts and Show posts to determine which receive the highest comments and on what exact hour of the day has the highest number of comments.

#### Libraries
No external library was used during the data cleaning and analysis in this project.


#### Conclusion
In this project, we are aimed at analyzing Ask posts and Show posts to determine which receives the highest comments and on what exact hour of the day has the highest number of comments.

Based on our analysis, Ask posts have more comments than Show post. And moving further, we were able to deduce that Ask posts receive more comments if posted in the midday towards evening around 3:00pm–4:00pm, and early hour of the day around 2:00am.

Hence, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, I would recommend Ask_HR news to be posted between in the morning by 2:00am and in the evening between 3:00pm–4:00pm.

However, it should be noted that the dataset used for this analysis excluded post without comments. To this effect, we would be more convinced that our results and conclusion are accurate.
